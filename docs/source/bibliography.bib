  abstract      = {Manual and mechanical ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation are critical yet poorly understood components of resuscitation care. In recent years, intra-arrest ventilation has been the subject of a growing number of laboratory and clinical investigations. Essential components to accurately interpret or reproduce original investigations are the exact measurement and transparent reporting of key ventilation parameters, such as volumes and airway pressures obtained during ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Chest compressions lead to frequent intrathoracic and intrapulmonary pressure rises which interact with artificial ventilation. The resulting unique phenomena during continuous chest compressions with asynchronous ventilation and an advanced airway necessitate a nuanced conceptualization supported by a common terminology.},
